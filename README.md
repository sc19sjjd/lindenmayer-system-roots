# lindenmayer-system-roots
Parametric L-Systems used to draw root like structures. Attempt at producing root structures using a GA on a pre-existing l-system's parameters.

To run:
1. Install ghostscript, `yum install ghostscript`
2. Install poetry, `pip install poetry`.
3. In root directory install dependencies, `poetry install`.
4. Run main with `poetry run python3 main.py`.

Alternatively install all required dependencies individually without poetry and run with standard `python3 main.py`.


There is currently no user interface so changes must be made directly to main.py.
